  "summary": "Diff adds an upgrade-migration scaffold (new backend/migration.mo with an OldActor state containing books/assets, posts, notes, forum data, suggestions, admin notifications, and userProfiles) and wires it into backend/main.mo via Motoko’s `(with migration = Migration.run) actor { ... }` syntax. However, backend/main.mo is truncated, so the diff summary does not provide enough visible evidence to confirm that all relevant runtime state is actually stored in stable-compatible fields and preserved across upgrades as required.",
